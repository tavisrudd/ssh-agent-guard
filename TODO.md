# TODO

- Add examples of bash/shell integration to docs (bashrc setup, testing
  rollout, verifying the proxy is in the path)
- Add rollout testing guide (how to dry-run policy changes, use
  --check mode to validate before switching)
- Consider making hasActiveDisplay() pluggable for non-sway compositors
- Consider goreleaser for automated cross-compilation releases
- Render man pages to markdown for GitHub browsing (mandoc -Tmarkdown)
